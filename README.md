## Node.js server

Run `npm run start:server` in console. You need to run `npm start` and `npm run start:server` together. Use different console instances.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Deployment

Run `npm run distribution` to build distribution of the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory. Use welllogwidgetexample.zip
